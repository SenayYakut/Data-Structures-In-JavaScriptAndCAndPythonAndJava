You might already be familiar with many smartphones that allow you to use a geometric pattern as a security measure. To unlock the device, you need to connect a sequence of dots/points in a grid by swiping your finger without lifting it as you trace the pattern through the screen.

For this kata, your job is to implement the function countPatternsFrom(firstPoint, length); where firstPoint is a single-character string corresponding to the point in the grid (i.e.: 'A') and length is an integer indicating the length of the pattern. The function must return the number of combinations starting from the given point, that have the given length.
