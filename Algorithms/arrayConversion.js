Given an array of 2k integers(for some integer k),perform the following operations until the array contains only one element
On the 1st, 3rd, 5th, etc iterations(1-based) replace each pair of consecutive elements with their sum.
On the 2nd, 4th, 6th etc iterations replace each pair of consecutive elements with their product. After the algorithm has finished, there will be a single element left in the array. Return that element.
